127,Directory Indexing,"An adversary crafts a request to a target that results in the target listing/indexing the content of a directory as output. One common method of triggering directory contents as output is to construct a request containing a path that terminates in a directory name rather than a file name since many applications are configured to provide a list of the directory's contents when such a request is received. An adversary can use this to explore the directory tree on a target as well as learn the names of files. This can often end up revealing test files, backup files, temporary files, hidden files, configuration files, user accounts, script contents, as well as naming conventions, all of which can be used by an attacker to mount additional attacks.",High,Medium,"::1. Using blank index.html: putting blank index.html simply prevent directory listings from displaying to site visitors.::2. Preventing with .htaccess in Apache web server: In .htaccess, write Options-indexes.::3. Suppressing error messages: using error 403 Forbidden message exactly like error 404 Not Found message.::","::The adversary uses directory listing to view sensitive files in the application. This is an example of accessing the backup file. The attack issues a request for http://www.example.com/admin/ and receives the following dynamic directory indexing content in the response: Index of /admin Name Last Modified Size Description backup/ 31-May-2007 08:18 - Apache/ 2.0.55 Server at www.example.com Port 80 The target application does not have direct hyperlink to the backup directory in the normal html webpage, however the attacker has learned of this directory due to indexing the content. The client then requests the backup directory URL and receives output which has a db_dump.php file in it. This sensitive data should not be disclosed publicly.::"
