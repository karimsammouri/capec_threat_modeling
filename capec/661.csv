661,Root/Jailbreak Detection Evasion via Debugging,"An adversary inserts a debugger into the program entry point of a mobile application to modify the application binary, with the goal of evading Root/Jailbreak detection. Mobile device users often Root/Jailbreak their devices in order to gain administrative control over the mobile operating system and/or to install third-party mobile applications that are not provided by authorized application stores (e.g. Google Play Store and Apple App Store). Rooting/Jailbreaking a mobile device also provides users with access to system debuggers and disassemblers, which can be leveraged to exploit applications by dumping the application's memory at runtime in order to remove or bypass signature verification methods. This further allows the adversary to evade Root/Jailbreak detection mechanisms, which can result in execution of administrative commands, obtaining confidential data, impersonating legitimate users of the application, and more.",Medium,Very High,::Instantiate checks within the application code that ensures debuggers are not attached.::,"::An adversary targets an iOS banking application in an attempt to compromise sensitive user data. The adversary launches the application with the iOS debugger and sets a breakpoint at the program entry point, after the application's signature has been verified. Next, the adversary dumps the memory region that contains the decrypted code from the address space of the binary. The 'Restrict' flag is then stripped from the application and the adversary resigns the application with a self-signed certificate. The application is now executed without the 'Restrict' flag, while trusting the self-signed certificate to be legitimate. However, the adversary is now able to evaded Jailbreak detection via code hooking or other methods and can glean user credentials and/or transaction details.::"
