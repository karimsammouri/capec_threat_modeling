271,Schema Poisoning,"An adversary corrupts or modifies the content of a schema for the purpose of undermining the security of the target. Schemas provide the structure and content definitions for resources used by an application. By replacing or modifying a schema, the adversary can affect how the application handles or interprets a resource, often leading to possible denial of service, entering into an unexpected state, or recording incomplete data.",Low,High,"::Design: Protect the schema against unauthorized modification.::Implementation: For applications that use a known schema, use a local copy or a known good repository instead of the schema reference supplied in the schema document.::Implementation: For applications that leverage remote schemas, use the HTTPS protocol to prevent modification of traffic in transit and to avoid unauthorized modification.::","::In a JSON Schema Poisoning Attack, an adervary modifies the JSON schema to cause a Denial of Service (DOS) or to submit malicious input: { title: Contact, type: object, properties: { Name: { type: string }, Phone: { type: string }, Email: { type: string }, Address: { type: string } }, required: [Name, Phone, Email, Address] } If the 'name' attribute is required in all submitted documents and this field is removed by the adversary, the application may enter an unexpected state or record incomplete data. Additionally, if this data is needed to perform additional functions, a Denial of Service (DOS) may occur.::In a Database Schema Poisoning Attack, an adversary alters the database schema being used to modify the database in some way. This can result in loss of data, DOS, or malicious input being submitted. Assuming there is a column named name, an adversary could make the following schema change: ALTER TABLE Contacts MODIFY Name VARCHAR(65353); The Name field of the Conteacts table now allows the storing of names up to 65353 characters in length. This could allow the adversary to store excess data within the database to consume system resource or to execute a DOS.::"
