104,Cross Zone Scripting,An attacker is able to cause a victim to load content into their web-browser that bypasses security zone controls and gain access to increased privileges to execute scripting code or other web objects such as unsigned ActiveX controls or applets. This is a privilege elevation attack targeted at zone-based web-browser security.,Medium,High,::Disable script execution.::Ensure that sufficient input validation is performed for any potentially untrusted data before it is used in any privileged context or zone::Limit the flow of untrusted data into the privileged areas of the system that run in the higher trust zone::Limit the sites that are being added to the local machine zone and restrict the privileges of the code running in that zone to the bare minimum::Ensure proper HTML output encoding before writing user supplied data to the page::,"::There was a cross zone scripting vulnerability discovered in Skype that allowed one user to upload a video with a maliciously crafted title that contains a script. Subsequently, when the victim attempts to use the add video to chat feature on attacker's video, the script embedded in the title of the video runs with local zone privileges. Skype is using IE web controls to render internal and external HTML pages. Add video to chat uses these web controls and they are running in the Local Zone. Any user who searched for the video in Skype with the same keywords as in the title field, would have the attackers' code executing in their browser with local zone privileges to their host machine (e.g. applications on the victim's host system could be executed).::"
