105,HTTP Request Splitting,"An adversary abuses the flexibility and discrepancies in the parsing and interpretation of HTTP Request messages by different intermediary HTTP agents (e.g., load balancer, reverse proxy, web caching proxies, application firewalls, etc.) to split a single HTTP request into multiple unauthorized and malicious HTTP requests to a back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server). See CanPrecede relationships for possible consequences.",Medium,High,::Design: evaluate HTTP agents prior to deployment for parsing/interpretation discrepancies.::Configuration: front-end HTTP agents notice ambiguous requests.::Configuration: back-end HTTP agents reject ambiguous requests and close the network connection.::Configuration: Disable reuse of back-end connections.::Configuration: Use HTTP/2 for back-end connections.::Configuration: Use the same web server software for front-end and back-end server.::Implementation: Utilize a Web Application Firewall (WAF) that has built-in mitigation to detect abnormal requests/responses.::Configuration: Install latest vendor security patches available for both intermediary and back-end HTTP infrastructure (i.e. proxies and web servers)::Configuration: Ensure that HTTP infrastructure in the chain or network path utilize a strict uniform parsing process.::Implementation: Utilize intermediary HTTP infrastructure capable of filtering and/or sanitizing user-input.::,"::Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.01 SP4 and prior, 6.0 SP2 and prior, and 7.0 contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote adversary to conduct HTTP request splitting and smuggling attacks. The vulnerability is due to an input validation error in the browser that allows adversaries to manipulate certain headers to expose the browser to HTTP request splitting and smuggling attacks. Attacks may include cross-site scripting, proxy cache poisoning, and session fixation. In certain instances, an exploit could allow the adversary to bypass web application firewalls or other filtering devices. Microsoft has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.::"
