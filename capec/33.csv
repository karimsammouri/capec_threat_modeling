33,HTTP Request Smuggling,"An adversary abuses the flexibility and discrepancies in the parsing and interpretation of HTTP Request messages using various HTTP headers, request-line and body parameters as well as message sizes (denoted by the end of message signaled by a given HTTP header) by different intermediary HTTP agents (e.g., load balancer, reverse proxy, web caching proxies, application firewalls, etc.) to secretly send unauthorized and malicious HTTP requests to a back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server). See CanPrecede relationships for possible consequences.",Medium,High,"::Design: evaluate HTTP agents prior to deployment for parsing/interpretation discrepancies.::Configuration: front-end HTTP agents notice ambiguous requests.::Configuration: back-end HTTP agents reject ambiguous requests and close the network connection.::Configuration: Disable reuse of back-end connections.::Configuration: Use HTTP/2 for back-end connections.::Configuration: Use the same web server software for front-end and back-end server.::Implementation: Utilize a Web Application Firewall (WAF) that has built-in mitigation to detect abnormal requests/responses.::Configuration: Prioritize Transfer-Encoding header over Content-Length, whenever an HTTP message contains both.::Configuration: Disallow HTTP messages with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length or Double Content-Length Headers.::Configuration: Disallow Malformed/Invalid Transfer-Encoding Headers used in obfuscation, such as: Headers with no space before the value “chunked” Headers with extra spaces Headers beginning with trailing characters Headers providing a value “chunk” instead of “chunked” (the server normalizes this as chunked encoding) Headers with multiple spaces before the value “chunked” Headers with quoted values (whether single or double quotations) Headers with CRLF characters before the value “chunked” Values with invalid characters::Configuration: Install latest vendor security patches available for both intermediary and back-end HTTP infrastructure (i.e. proxies and web servers)::Configuration: Ensure that HTTP infrastructure in the chain or network path utilize a strict uniform parsing process.::Implementation: Utilize intermediary HTTP infrastructure capable of filtering and/or sanitizing user-input.::","::When using Haproxy 1.5.3 version as front-end proxy server with with Node.js version 14.13.1 or 12.19.0 as the back-end web server it is possible to use two same header fields for example: two Transfer-Encoding, Transfer-Encoding: chunked and Transfer-Encoding: chunked-false, to bypass Haproxy /flag URI restriction and receive the Haproxy flag value, since Node.js identifies the first header but ignores the second header. See also: CVE-2020-8287::When using Sun Java System Web Proxy Server 3.x or 4.x in conjunction with Sun ONE/iPlanet 6.x, Sun Java System Application Server 7.x or 8.x, it is possible to bypass certain application firewall protections, hijack web sessions, perform Cross Site Scripting or poison the web proxy cache using HTTP Request Smuggling. Differences in the way HTTP requests are parsed by the Proxy Server and the Application Server enable malicious requests to be smuggled through to the Application Server, thereby exposing the Application Server to aforementioned attacks. See also: CVE-2006-6276::Apache server 2.0.45 and version before 1.3.34, when used as a proxy, easily lead to web cache poisoning and bypassing of application firewall restrictions because of non-standard HTTP behavior. Although the HTTP/1.1 specification clearly states that a request with both Content-Length and a Transfer-Encoding: chunked headers is invalid, vulnerable versions of Apache accept such requests and reassemble the ones with Transfer-Encoding: chunked header without replacing the existing Content-Length header or adding its own. This leads to HTTP Request Smuggling using a request with a chunked body and a header with Content-Length: 0. See also: CVE-2005-2088::"
