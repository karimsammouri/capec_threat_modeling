57,Utilizing REST's Trust in the System Resource to Obtain Sensitive Data,This attack utilizes a REST(REpresentational State Transfer)-style applications' trust in the system resources and environment to obtain sensitive data once SSL is terminated.,Medium,Very High,"::Implementation: Implement message level security such as HMAC in the HTTP communication::Design: Utilize defense in depth, do not rely on a single security mechanism like SSL::Design: Enforce principle of least privilege::","::The Rest service provider uses SSL to protect the communications between the service requester (client) to the service provider. In the instance where SSL is terminated before the communications reach the web server, it is very common in enterprise data centers to terminate SSL at a router, firewall, load balancer, proxy or other device, then the adversary can insert a sniffer into the communication stream and gather all the authentication tokens (such as session credentials, username/passwords combinations, and so on). The Rest service requester and service provider do not have any way to detect this attack.::"
