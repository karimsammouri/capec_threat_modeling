671,Requirements for ASIC Functionality Maliciously Altered,"An adversary with access to functional requirements for an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a chip designed/customized for a singular particular use, maliciously alters requirements derived from originating capability needs. In the chip manufacturing process, requirements drive the chip design which, when the chip is fully manufactured, could result in an ASIC which may not meet the user’s needs, contain malicious functionality, or exhibit other anomalous behaviors thereby affecting the intended use of the ASIC.",Low,High,"::Utilize DMEA’s (Defense Microelectronics Activity) Trusted Foundry Program members for acquisition of microelectronic components.::Ensure that each supplier performing hardware development implements comprehensive, security-focused configuration management including for hardware requirements and design.::Require that provenance of COTS microelectronic components be known whenever procured.::Conduct detailed vendor assessment before acquiring COTS hardware.::","::An adversary with access to ASIC functionality requirements for various customers, targets a particular customer’s ordered lot of ASICs by altering its functional requirements such that the ASIC design will result in a manufactured chip that does not meet the customer’s capability needs.::"
