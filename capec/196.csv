196,Session Credential Falsification through Forging,"An attacker creates a false but functional session credential in order to gain or usurp access to a service. Session credentials allow users to identify themselves to a service after an initial authentication without needing to resend the authentication information (usually a username and password) with every message. If an attacker is able to forge valid session credentials they may be able to bypass authentication or piggy-back off some other authenticated user's session. This attack differs from Reuse of Session IDs and Session Sidejacking attacks in that in the latter attacks an attacker uses a previous or existing credential without modification while, in a forging attack, the attacker must create their own credential, although it may be based on previously observed credentials.",Medium,Medium,"::Implementation: Use session IDs that are difficult to guess or brute-force: One way for the attackers to obtain valid session IDs is by brute-forcing or guessing them. By choosing session identifiers that are sufficiently random, brute-forcing or guessing becomes very difficult.::Implementation: Regenerate and destroy session identifiers when there is a change in the level of privilege: This ensures that even though a potential victim may have followed a link with a fixated identifier, a new one is issued when the level of privilege changes.::","::This example uses client side scripting to set session ID in the victim's browser. The JavaScript code document.cookie=sessionid=0123456789 fixates a falsified session credential into victim's browser, with the help of crafted a URL link. http://www.example.com/<script>document.cookie=sessionid=0123456789;</script> A similar example uses session ID as an argument of the URL. http://www.example.com/index.php/sessionid=0123456789 Once the victim clicks the links, the attacker may be able to bypass authentication or piggy-back off some other authenticated victim's session.::"
