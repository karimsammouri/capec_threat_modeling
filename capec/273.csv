273,HTTP Response Smuggling,"An adversary manipulates and injects malicious content in the form of secret unauthorized HTTP responses, into a single HTTP response from a vulnerable or compromised back-end HTTP agent (e.g., server). See CanPrecede relationships for possible consequences.",Medium,High,"::Design: evaluate HTTP agents prior to deployment for parsing/interpretation discrepancies.::Configuration: front-end HTTP agents notice ambiguous requests.::Configuration: back-end HTTP agents reject ambiguous requests and close the network connection.::Configuration: Disable reuse of back-end connections.::Configuration: Use HTTP/2 for back-end connections.::Configuration: Use the same web server software for front-end and back-end server.::Implementation: Utilize a Web Application Firewall (WAF) that has built-in mitigation to detect abnormal requests/responses.::Configuration: Prioritize Transfer-Encoding header over Content-Length, whenever an HTTP message contains both.::Configuration: Disallow HTTP messages with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length or Double Content-Length Headers.::Configuration: Disallow Malformed/Invalid Transfer-Encoding Headers used in obfuscation, such as: Headers with no space before the value “chunked” Headers with extra spaces Headers beginning with trailing characters Headers providing a value “chunk” instead of “chunked” (the server normalizes this as chunked encoding) Headers with multiple spaces before the value “chunked” Headers with quoted values (whether single or double quotations) Headers with CRLF characters before the value “chunked” Values with invalid characters::Configuration: Install latest vendor security patches available for both intermediary and back-end HTTP infrastructure (i.e. proxies and web servers)::Configuration: Ensure that HTTP infrastructure in the chain or network path utilize a strict uniform parsing process.::Implementation: Utilize intermediary HTTP infrastructure capable of filtering and/or sanitizing user-input.::","::When using Undertow, a Java-based web server in Red Hat's Jboss Enterprise Application Platform version 7.0, the code responsible for parsing HTTP requests permitted invalid characters, that could allow the injection of data into HTTP responses from Undertow to clients when used in tandem with a proxy; allowing for web-cache poisoning, XSS, and confidentiality violation of sensitive information from other HTTP requests sent to Undertow. See also: CVE-2017-2666::Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird before 1.5.04, with various proxy servers, interpreted HTTP responses differently if HTTP response headers included a space between the header name and colon or if HTTP 1.1 headers were sent through a proxy configured with HTTP 1.0, allowing for HTTP Smuggling vulnerability.
