34,HTTP Response Splitting,"An adversary manipulates and injects malicious content, in the form of secret unauthorized HTTP responses, into a single HTTP response from a vulnerable or compromised back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server) or into an already spoofed HTTP response from an adversary controlled domain/site. See CanPrecede relationships for possible consequences.",Medium,High,::Design: evaluate HTTP agents prior to deployment for parsing/interpretation discrepancies.::Configuration: front-end HTTP agents notice ambiguous requests.::Configuration: back-end HTTP agents reject ambiguous requests and close the network connection.::Configuration: Disable reuse of back-end connections.::Configuration: Use HTTP/2 for back-end connections.::Configuration: Use the same web server software for front-end and back-end server.::Implementation: Utilize a Web Application Firewall (WAF) that has built-in mitigation to detect abnormal requests/responses.::Configuration: Install latest vendor security patches available for both intermediary and back-end HTTP infrastructure (i.e. proxies and web servers)::Configuration: Ensure that HTTP infrastructure in the chain or network path utilize a strict uniform parsing process.::Implementation: Utilize intermediary HTTP infrastructure capable of filtering and/or sanitizing user-input.::,"::In the PHP 5 session extension mechanism, a user-supplied session ID is sent back to the user within the Set-Cookie HTTP header. Since the contents of the user-supplied session ID are not validated, it is possible to inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the response body. This immediately enables HTTP Response Splitting by simply terminating the HTTP response header from within the session ID used in the Set-Cookie directive. See also: CVE-2006-0207::"
