139,Relative Path Traversal,"An attacker exploits a weakness in input validation on the target by supplying a specially constructed path utilizing dot and slash characters for the purpose of obtaining access to arbitrary files or resources. An attacker modifies a known path on the target in order to reach material that is not available through intended channels. These attacks normally involve adding additional path separators (/ or ) and/or dots (.), or encodings thereof, in various combinations in order to reach parent directories or entirely separate trees of the target's directory structure.",High,High,"::Design: Input validation. Assume that user inputs are malicious. Utilize strict type, character, and encoding enforcement::Implementation: Perform input validation for all remote content, including remote and user-generated content.::Implementation: Validate user input by only accepting known good. Ensure all content that is delivered to client is sanitized against an acceptable content specification -- using an allowlist approach.::Implementation: Prefer working without user input when using file system calls::Implementation: Use indirect references rather than actual file names.::Implementation: Use possible permissions on file access when developing and deploying web applications.::","::The attacker uses relative path traversal to access files in the application. This is an example of accessing user's password file. http://www.example.com/getProfile.jsp?filename=../../../../etc/passwd However, the target application employs regular expressions to make sure no relative path sequences are being passed through the application to the web page. The application would replace all matches from this regex with the empty string. Then an attacker creates special payloads to bypass this filter: http://www.example.com/getProfile.jsp?filename=%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e /etc/passwd When the application gets this input string, it will be the desired vector by the attacker.::"
