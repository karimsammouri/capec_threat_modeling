45,Buffer Overflow via Symbolic Links,"This type of attack leverages the use of symbolic links to cause buffer overflows. An adversary can try to create or manipulate a symbolic link file such that its contents result in out of bounds data. When the target software processes the symbolic link file, it could potentially overflow internal buffers with insufficient bounds checking.",High,High,"::Pay attention to the fact that the resource you read from can be a replaced by a Symbolic link. You can do a Symlink check before reading the file and decide that this is not a legitimate way of accessing the resource.::Because Symlink can be modified by an adversary, make sure that the ones you read are located in protected directories.::Pay attention to the resource pointed to by your symlink links (See attack pattern named Forced Symlink race), they can be replaced by malicious resources.::Always check the size of the input data before copying to a buffer.::Use a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking.::Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.::Compiler-based canary mechanisms such as StackGuard, ProPolice and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag. Unless this provides automatic bounds checking, it is not a complete solution.::Use OS-level preventative functionality. Not a complete solution.::","::The EFTP server has a buffer overflow that can be exploited if an adversary uploads a .lnk (link) file that contains more than 1,744 bytes. This is a classic example of an indirect buffer overflow. First the adversary uploads some content (the link file) and then the adversary causes the client consuming the data to be exploited. In this example, the ls command is exploited to compromise the server software.::"
