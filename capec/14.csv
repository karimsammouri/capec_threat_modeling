14,Client-side Injection-induced Buffer Overflow,"This type of attack exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in targeted client software through injection of malicious content from a custom-built hostile service. This hostile service is created to deliver the correct content to the client software. For example, if the client-side application is a browser, the service will host a webpage that the browser loads.",Medium,High,"::The client software should not install untrusted code from a non-authenticated server.::The client software should have the latest patches and should be audited for vulnerabilities before being used to communicate with potentially hostile servers.::Perform input validation for length of buffer inputs.::Use a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking.::Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.::Compiler-based canary mechanisms such as StackGuard, ProPolice and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag. Unless this provides automatic bounds checking, it is not a complete solution.::Ensure all buffer uses are consistently bounds-checked.::Use OS-level preventative functionality. Not a complete solution.::","::Authors often use <EMBED> tags in HTML documents. For example <EMBED TYPE=audio/midi SRC=/path/file.mid AUTOSTART=true> In Internet Explorer 4.0 an adversary attacker supplies an overly long path in the SRC= directive, the mshtml.dll component will suffer a buffer overflow. This is a standard example of content in a Web page being directed to exploit a faulty module in the system. There are potentially thousands of different ways data can propagate into a given system, thus these kinds of attacks will continue to be found in the wild.::"
