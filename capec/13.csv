13,Subverting Environment Variable Values,The adversary directly or indirectly modifies environment variables used by or controlling the target software. The adversary's goal is to cause the target software to deviate from its expected operation in a manner that benefits the adversary.,High,Very High,::Protect environment variables against unauthorized read and write access.::Protect the configuration files which contain environment variables against illegitimate read and write access.::Assume all input is malicious. Create an allowlist that defines all valid input to the software system based on the requirements specifications. Input that does not match against the allowlist should not be permitted to enter into the system.::Apply the least privilege principles. If a process has no legitimate reason to read an environment variable do not give that privilege.::,"::Changing the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable in TELNET will cause TELNET to use an alternate (possibly Trojan) version of a function library. The Trojan library must be accessible using the target file system and should include Trojan code that will allow the user to log in with a bad password. This requires that the adversary upload the Trojan library to a specific location on the target. As an alternative to uploading a Trojan file, some file systems support file paths that include remote addresses, such as 172.16.2.100shared_filestrojan_dll.dll. See also: Path Manipulation (CVE-1999-0073)::The HISTCONTROL environment variable keeps track of what should be saved by the history command and eventually into the ~/.bash_history file when a user logs out. This setting can be configured to ignore commands that start with a space by simply setting it to ignorespace. HISTCONTROL can also be set to ignore duplicate commands by setting it to ignoredups. In some Linux systems, this is set by default to ignoreboth which covers both of the previous examples. This means that ls will not be saved, but ls would be saved by history. HISTCONTROL does not exist by default on macOS, but can be set by the user and will be respected. Adversaries can use this to operate without leaving traces by simply prepending a space to all of their terminal commands.::"
