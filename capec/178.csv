178,Cross-Site Flashing,"An attacker is able to trick the victim into executing a Flash document that passes commands or calls to a Flash player browser plugin, allowing the attacker to exploit native Flash functionality in the client browser. This attack pattern occurs where an attacker can provide a crafted link to a Flash document (SWF file) which, when followed, will cause additional malicious instructions to be executed. The attacker does not need to serve or control the Flash document. The attack takes advantage of the fact that Flash files can reference external URLs. If variables that serve as URLs that the Flash application references can be controlled through parameters, then by creating a link that includes values for those parameters, an attacker can cause arbitrary content to be referenced and possibly executed by the targeted Flash application.",Medium,Medium,::Implementation: Only allow known URL to be included as remote flash movies in a flash application::Configuration: Properly configure the crossdomain.xml file to only include the known domains that should host remote flash movies.::,"::The attacker tries to get their malicious flash movie to be executed in the targeted flash application. The malicious file is hosted on the attacker.com domain and the targeted flash application is hosted on example.com The crossdomain.xml file in the root of example.com allows all domains and no specific restriction is specified in the targeted flash application. When the attacker injects their malicious file in the vulnerable flash movie, the rogue flash application is able to access internal variables and parameter of the flash movie.::"
