663,Exploitation of Transient Instruction Execution,"An adversary exploits a hardware design flaw in a CPU implementation of transient instruction execution to expose sensitive data and bypass/subvert access control over restricted resources. Typically, the adversary conducts a covert channel attack to target non-discarded microarchitectural changes caused by transient executions such as speculative execution, branch prediction, instruction pipelining, and/or out-of-order execution. The transient execution results in a series of instructions (gadgets) which construct covert channel and access/transfer the secret data.",Low,Very High,::Implementation: DAWG (Dynamically Allocated Way Guard) - processor cache properly divided between different programs/processes that don't share resources::Implementation: KPTI (Kernel Page-Table Isolation) to completely separate user-space and kernel space page tables::Configuration: Architectural Design of Microcode to limit abuse of speculative execution and out-of-order execution::Configuration: Disable SharedArrayBuffer for Web Browsers::Configuration: Disable Copy-on-Write between Cloud VMs::Configuration: Privilege Checks on Cache Flush Instructions::Implementation: Non-inclusive Cache Memories to prevent Flush+Reload Attacks::,"::A web browser with user-privileges executes JavaScript code imbedded within a malicious website. The system does not disable shared buffers for the web browser and there is no restriction or check upon user-process execution of flush or evict instructions. The Javascript code executes vulnerable transient instructions upon system to cause microarchitectural changes that establish covert channel and transfer sensitive/secret data into shared cache from address space of either kernel, web browser or another executing process on the system.::"
