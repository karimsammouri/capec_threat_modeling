682,Exploitation of Firmware or ROM Code with Unpatchable Vulnerabilities,"An adversary may exploit vulnerable code (i.e., firmware or ROM) that is unpatchable. Unpatchable devices exist due to manufacturers intentionally or inadvertently designing devices incapable of updating their software. Additionally, with updatable devices, the manufacturer may decide not to support the device and stop making updates to their software.",Medium,High,::Design systems and products with the ability to patch firmware or ROM code after deployment to fix vulnerabilities.::Make use of OTA (Over-the-air) updates so that firmware can be patched remotely either through manual or automatic means::,"::An IoT company comes out with a line of smart products for home use such as home cameras, vacuums, and smart bulbs. The products become popular, and millions of consumers install these devices in their homes. All the devices use a custom module for encryption that is stored on a ROM chip, which is immutable memory and can't be changed. An adversary discovers that there is a vulnerability in the encryption module code that allows authentication bypass, gaining access to any device. The adversary then develops botnet code that is remotely downloaded onto the infected devices. This code scans the internet for nearby devices from the same product line and exploits the vulnerability, loading the botnet code onto these new devices. Over time, the adversary now has a botnet of devices that can carry out malicious activity such as a DDoS attacks. Once the vulnerability is found, it is impossible to remediate because the vulnerable code is unable to be updated.::Older smartphones can become out of date and manufacturers may stop putting out security updates as they focus on newer models. If an adversary discovers a vulnerability in an old smartphone there is a chance that a security update will not be made to mitigate it. This leaves anyone using the old smartphone vulnerable.::"
