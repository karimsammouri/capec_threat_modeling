A general approach entails the adversary placing themself within the communication channel between the two components.",High,Very High,"::Ensure Public Keys are signed by a Certificate Authority::Encrypt communications using cryptography (e.g., SSL/TLS)::Use Strong mutual authentication to always fully authenticate both ends of any communications channel.::Exchange public keys using a secure channel::","::In 2017, security researcher Jerry Decime discovered that Equifax mobile applications were not leveraging HTTPS in all areas. Although authentication was properly utilizing HTTPS, in addition to validating the root of trust of the server certificate, other areas of the application were using HTTP to communicate. Adversaries could then conduct MITM attacks on rogue WiFi or cellular networks and hijack the UX. This further allowed the adversaries to prompt users for sensitive data, which could then be obtained in the plaintext response. [REF-636]::"
