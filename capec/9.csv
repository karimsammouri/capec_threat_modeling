9,Buffer Overflow in Local Command-Line Utilities,This attack targets command-line utilities available in a number of shells. An adversary can leverage a vulnerability found in a command-line utility to escalate privilege to root.,High,High,"::Carefully review the service's implementation before making it available to user. For instance you can use manual or automated code review to uncover vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow.::Use a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking.::Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.::Compiler-based canary mechanisms such as StackGuard, ProPolice and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag. Unless this provides automatic bounds checking, it is not a complete solution.::Operational: Use OS-level preventative functionality. Not a complete solution.::Apply the latest patches to your user exposed services. This may not be a complete solution, especially against a zero day attack.::Do not unnecessarily expose services.::",::Attack Example: HPUX passwd A buffer overflow in the HPUX passwd command allows local users to gain root privileges via a command-line option. Attack Example: Solaris getopt A buffer overflow in Solaris's getopt command (found in libc) allows local users to gain root privileges via a long argv[0].::
