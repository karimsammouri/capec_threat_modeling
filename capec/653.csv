653,Use of Known Operating System Credentials,"An adversary guesses or obtains (i.e. steals or purchases) legitimate operating system credentials (e.g. userID/password) to achieve authentication and to perform authorized actions on the system, under the guise of an authenticated user or service. This applies to any Operating System.",High,High,"::Leverage multi-factor authentication for all authentication services and prior to granting an entity access to the network.::Create a strong password policy and ensure that your system enforces this policy.::Ensure users are not reusing username/password combinations for multiple systems, applications, or services.::Do not reuse local administrator account credentials across systems.::Deny remote use of local admin credentials to log into domain systems.::Do not allow accounts to be a local administrator on more than one system.::Implement an intelligent password throttling mechanism. Care must be taken to assure that these mechanisms do not excessively enable account lockout attacks such as CAPEC-2.::Monitor system and domain logs for abnormal credential access.::","::Adversaries exploited the Zoom video conferencing application during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic to exfiltrate Windows domain credentials from a target system. The attack entailed sending Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths within the Zoom chat window of an unprotected Zoom call. If the victim clicked on the link, their Windows usernames and the corresponding Net-NTLM-v2 hashes were sent to the address contained in the link. The adversary was then able to infiltrate and laterally move within the Windows domain by passing the acquired credentials to shared network resources. This further provided adversaries with access to Outlook servers and network storage devices. [REF-575]::Mimikatz, a post-exploitation Windows credential harvester, can be used to gather and exploit Windows credentials. This malware has been used in several known cyberattacks, such as the Petya Ransomeware attacks. [REF-576]::"
