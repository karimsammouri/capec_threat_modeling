679,Exploitation of Improperly Configured or Implemented Memory Protections,An adversary takes advantage of missing or incorrectly configured access control within memory to read/write data or inject malicious code into said memory.,Medium,Very High,"::Ensure that protected and unprotected memory ranges are isolated and do not overlap.::If memory regions must overlap, leverage memory priority schemes if memory regions can overlap.::Ensure that original and mirrored memory regions apply the same protections.::Ensure immutable code or data is programmed into ROM or write-once memory.::","::A hardware product contains non-volatile memory, which itself contains boot code that is insufficiently protected. An adversary then modifies this memory to either bypass the secure boot process or to execute their own code.::A hardware product leverages a CPU that does not possess a memory-protection unit (MPU) and a memory-management unit (MMU) nor a special bit to support write exclusivity, resulting in no write exclusivity. Because of this, an adversary is able to inject malicious code into the memory and later execute it to achieve the desired outcome.::"
