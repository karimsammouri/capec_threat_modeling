44,Overflow Binary Resource File,"An attack of this type exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the handling of binary resources. Binary resources may include music files like MP3, image files like JPEG files, and any other binary file. These attacks may pass unnoticed to the client machine through normal usage of files, such as a browser loading a seemingly innocent JPEG file. This can allow the adversary access to the execution stack and execute arbitrary code in the target process.",High,Very High,"::Perform appropriate bounds checking on all buffers.::Design: Enforce principle of least privilege::Design: Static code analysis::Implementation: Execute program in less trusted process space environment, do not allow lower integrity processes to write to higher integrity processes::Implementation: Keep software patched to ensure that known vulnerabilities are not available for adversaries to target on host.::","::Binary files like music and video files are appended with additional data to cause buffer overflow on target systems. Because these files may be filled with otherwise popular content, the adversary has an excellent vector for wide distribution. There have been numerous cases, for example of malicious screen savers for sports teams that are distributed on the event of the team winning a championship.::"
