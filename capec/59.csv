59,Session Credential Falsification through Prediction,This attack targets predictable session ID in order to gain privileges. The attacker can predict the session ID used during a transaction to perform spoofing and session hijacking.,High,High,"::Use a strong source of randomness to generate a session ID.::Use adequate length session IDs::Do not use information available to the user in order to generate session ID (e.g., time).::Ideas for creating random numbers are offered by Eastlake [RFC1750]::Encrypt the session ID if you expose it to the user. For instance session ID can be stored in a cookie in encrypted format.::","::Jetty before 4.2.27, 5.1 before 5.1.12, 6.0 before 6.0.2, and 6.1 before 6.1.0pre3 generates predictable session identifiers using java.util.random, which makes it easier for remote attackers to guess a session identifier through brute force attacks, bypass authentication requirements, and possibly conduct cross-site request forgery attacks. See also: CVE-2006-6969::mod_usertrack in Apache 1.3.11 through 1.3.20 generates session ID's using predictable information including host IP address, system time and server process ID, which allows local users to obtain session ID's and bypass authentication when these session ID's are used for authentication.
