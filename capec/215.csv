215,Fuzzing for application mapping,"An attacker sends random, malformed, or otherwise unexpected messages to a target application and observes the application's log or error messages returned. The attacker does not initially know how a target will respond to individual messages but by attempting a large number of message variants they may find a variant that trigger's desired behavior. In this attack, the purpose of the fuzzing is to observe the application's log and error messages, although fuzzing a target can also sometimes cause the target to enter an unstable state, causing a crash.",High,Low,"::Design: Construct a 'code book' for error messages. When using a code book, application error messages aren't generated in string or stack trace form, but are catalogued and replaced with a unique (often integer-based) value 'coding' for the error. Such a technique will require helpdesk and hosting personnel to use a 'code book' or similar mapping to decode application errors/logs in order to respond to them normally.::Design: wrap application functionality (preferably through the underlying framework) in an output encoding scheme that obscures or cleanses error messages to prevent such attacks. Such a technique is often used in conjunction with the above 'code book' suggestion.::Implementation: Obfuscate server fields of HTTP response.::Implementation: Hide inner ordering of HTTP response header.::Implementation: Customizing HTTP error codes such as 404 or 500.::Implementation: Hide HTTP response header software information filed.::Implementation: Hide cookie's software information filed.::Implementation: Obfuscate database type in Database API's error message.::","::The following code generates an error message that leaks the full pathname of the configuration file. $ConfigDir = /home/myprog/config;$uname = GetUserInput(username);ExitError(Bad hacker!) if ($uname !~ /^w+$/);$file = $ConfigDir/$uname.txt;if (! (-e $file)) { ExitError(Error: $file does not exist); }... If this code is running on a server, such as a web application, then the person making the request should not know what the full pathname of the configuration directory is. By submitting a username that does not produce a $file that exists, an attacker could get this pathname. It could then be used to exploit path traversal or symbolic link following problems that may exist elsewhere in the application.::In languages that utilize stack traces, revealing them can give adversaries information that allows them to map functions and file locations for an application. The following Java method prints out a stack trace that exposes the application to this attack pattern. public void httpGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {try {processRequest();} catch (Exception ex) {ex.printStackTrace(response.getWriter()); return;}} If this code is running on a server, such as a web application, then the adversary could cause the exception to be printed through fuzzing.::"
