591,Reflected XSS,This type of attack is a form of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) where a malicious script is reflected off a vulnerable web application and then executed by a victim's browser. The process starts with an adversary delivering a malicious script to a victim and convincing the victim to send the script to the vulnerable web application.,High,Very High,"::Use browser technologies that do not allow client-side scripting.::Utilize strict type, character, and encoding enforcement.::Ensure that all user-supplied input is validated before use.::","::Consider a web application that enables or disables some of the fields of a form on the page via the use of a mode parameter provided on the query string. http://my.site.com/aform.html?mode=full The application’s server-side code may want to display this mode value in the HTML page being created to give the users an understanding of what mode they are in. In this example, PHP is used to pull the value from the URL and generate the desired HTML. <?phpecho 'Mode is: ' . $_GET[mode];?> Notice how the value provided on the URL is used directly with no input validation performed and no output encoding in place. A maliciously crafted URL can thus be formed such that if a victim clicked on the URL, a malicious script would then be executed by the victim’s browser: http://my.site.com/aform.html?mode=<script>alert('hi');</script>::Reflected XSS attacks can take advantage of HTTP headers to compromise a victim. For example, assume a vulnerable web application called ‘mysite’ dynamically generates a link using an HTTP header such as HTTP_REFERER. Code somewhere in the application could look like: <?phpecho <a href=$_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']>Test URL</a>?> The HTTP_REFERER header is populated with the URI that linked to the currently executing page. A web site can be created and hosted by an adversary that takes advantage of this by adding a reference to the vulnerable web application. By tricking a victim into clicking a link that executes the attacker’s web page, such as: http://attackerswebsite.com?<script>malicious content</script> The vulnerable web application ('mysite') is now called via the attacker's web site, initiated by the victim's web browser. The HTTP_REFERER header will contain a malicious script, which is embedded into the page by the vulnerable application and served to the victim. The victim’s web browser then executes the injected script, thus compromising the victim’s machine.::"
