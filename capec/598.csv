598,DNS Spoofing,"An adversary sends a malicious (NXDOMAIN (No such domain) code, or DNS A record) response to a target's route request before a legitimate resolver can. This technique requires an On-path or In-path device that can monitor and respond to the target's DNS requests. This attack differs from BGP Tampering in that it directly responds to requests made by the target instead of polluting the routing the target's infrastructure uses.",,,::Design: Avoid dependence on DNS::Design: Include hosts file/IP address in the application::Implementation: Utilize a .onion domain with Tor support::Implementation: DNSSEC::Implementation: DNS-hold-open::,"::Below-Recursive DNS Poisoning: When an On/In-path device between a recursive DNS server and a user sends a malicious (NXDOMAIN (No such domain) code, or DNS A record ) response before a legitimate resolver can.::Above-Recursive DNS Poisoning: When an On/In-path device between an authority server (e.g., government-managed) and a recursive DNS server sends a malicious (NXDOMAIN (No such domain)code, or a DNS record) response before a legitimate resolver can.::"
