29,Leveraging Time-of-Check and Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Conditions,"This attack targets a race condition occurring between the time of check (state) for a resource and the time of use of a resource. A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by running the race, meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly.",High,High,"::Use safe libraries to access resources such as files.::Be aware that improper use of access function calls such as chown(), tempfile(), chmod(), etc. can cause a race condition.::Use synchronization to control the flow of execution.::Use static analysis tools to find race conditions.::Pay attention to concurrency problems related to the access of resources.::","::The Net Direct client for Linux before 6.0.5 in Nortel Application Switch 2424, VPN 3050 and 3070, and SSL VPN Module 1000 extracts and executes files with insecure permissions, which allows local users to exploit a race condition to replace a world-writable file in /tmp/NetClient and cause another user to execute arbitrary code when attempting to execute this client, as demonstrated by replacing /tmp/NetClient/client.
