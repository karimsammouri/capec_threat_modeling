A BitSquatting attack leverages random errors in memory to direct Internet traffic to adversary-controlled destinations. BitSquatting requires no exploitation or complicated reverse engineering, and is operating system and architecture agnostic. Experimental observations show that BitSquatting popular websites could redirect non-trivial amounts of Internet traffic to a malicious entity.",Low,Medium,"::Authenticate all servers and perform redundant checks when using DNS hostnames.::When possible, use error-correcting (ECC) memory in local devices as non-ECC memory is significantly more vulnerable to faults.::",
