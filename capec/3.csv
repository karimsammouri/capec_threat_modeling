3,Using Leading 'Ghost' Character Sequences to Bypass Input Filters,"Some APIs will strip certain leading characters from a string of parameters. An adversary can intentionally introduce leading ghost characters (extra characters that don't affect the validity of the request at the API layer) that enable the input to pass the filters and therefore process the adversary's input. This occurs when the targeted API will accept input data in several syntactic forms and interpret it in the equivalent semantic way, while the filter does not take into account the full spectrum of the syntactic forms acceptable to the targeted API.",Medium,Medium,::Use an allowlist rather than a denylist input validation.::Canonicalize all data prior to validation.::Take an iterative approach to input validation (defense in depth).::,"::Alternate Encoding with Ghost Characters in FTP and Web Servers Some web and FTP servers fail to detect prohibited upward directory traversals if the user-supplied pathname contains extra characters such as an extra leading dot. For example, a program that will disallow access to the pathname ../test.txt may erroneously allow access to that file if the pathname is specified as .../test.txt. This attack succeeds because 1) the input validation logic fails to detect the triple-dot as a directory traversal attempt (since it isn't dot-dot), 2) some part of the input processing decided to strip off the extra dot, leaving the dot-dot behind. Using the file system API as the target, the following strings are all equivalent to many programs: .../../../test.txt............/../../test.txt..?/../../test.txt..????????/../../test.txt../test.txt As you can see, there are many ways to make a semantically equivalent request. All these strings ultimately result in a request for the file ../test.txt.::"
