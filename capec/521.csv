521,Hardware Design Specifications Are Altered,"An attacker with access to a manufacturer's hardware manufacturing process documentation alters the design specifications, which introduces flaws advantageous to the attacker once the system is deployed.",Low,High,::Digitize documents and cryptographically sign them to verify authenticity.::Password protect documents and make them read-only for unauthorized users.::Avoid emailing important documents and configurations.::Ensure deleted files are actually deleted.::Maintain backups of the document for recovery and verification.::Separate need-to-know information from system configuration information depending on the user.::,"::To operate at full capability, a manufacturer's network intrusion detection device needs to have either a Intel Xeon E7-2820 or AMD FX-8350 which have 8 cores available, allowing for advanced threading needed to handle large volumes of network traffic without resorting to dropping packets from the detection process. The attacker alters the documentation to state that the system design must use the Intel Core Duo or the AMD Phenom II X2, which only have 2 cores, causing the system to drop large amounts of packets during deployment at a victim site with large amounts of network traffic.::"
