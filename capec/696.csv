696,Load Value Injection,"An adversary exploits a hardware design flaw in a CPU implementation of transient instruction execution in which a faulting or assisted load instruction transiently forwards adversary-controlled data from microarchitectural buffers. By inducing a page fault or microcode assist during victim execution, an adversary can force legitimate victim execution to operate on the adversary-controlled data which is stored in the microarchitectural buffers. The adversary can then use existing code gadgets and side channel analysis to discover victim secrets that have not yet been flushed from microarchitectural state or hijack the system control flow.",Low,Very High,"::Do not allow the forwarding of data resulting from a faulting or assisted instruction. Some current mitigations claim to zero out the forwarded data, but this mitigation still does not suffice.::Insert explicit “lfence” speculation barriers in software before potentially faulting or assisted loads. This halts transient execution until all previous instructions have been executed and ensures that the architecturally correct value is forwarded.::",
