681,Exploitation of Improperly Controlled Hardware Security Identifiers,"An adversary takes advantage of missing or incorrectly configured security identifiers (e.g., tokens), which are used for access control within a System-on-Chip (SoC), to read/write data or execute a given action.",Medium,Very High,"::Review generation of security identifiers for design inconsistencies and common weaknesses.::Review security identifier decoders for design inconsistencies and common weaknesses.::Test security identifier definition, access, and programming flow in both pre-silicon and post-silicon environments.::","::A system contains a register (divided into four 32-bit registers) that is used to store a 128-bit AES key for encryption/decryption, in addition to an access-policy register. The access-policy register determines which agents may access the AES-key registers, based on a corresponding security identifier. It is assumed the system has two agents: a Main-controller and an Aux-controller, with respective security identifiers 1 and 2. The Main-controller (ID 1) is meant to have access to the AES-key registers, while the Aux-controller (ID 2) has access to the access-policy register. If a SoC incorrectly generates security identifier 1 for both agents, then both agents will have access to the AES-key registers. This could further result in a Denial-of-Service (DoS) or the execution of an action that in turn could result in privilege escalation or unintended access.::"
